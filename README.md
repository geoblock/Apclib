The library includes astronomy.c from the https://github.com/cosinekitty/astronomy project
and astronomy.pas unit that was automatically generated by: https://github.com/neslib/Chet
to use astronomy.dll with the astronomy.pas for your Delphi & C++Builder applications
as well as modules with routines from www.hnsky.org for working with constellation boundaries 
and calculating ephemeris along with IAU SOFA library www.iausofa.org.

For rendering and visualisation GLScene's components 
from https://github.com/glScene/GLScene are used.
